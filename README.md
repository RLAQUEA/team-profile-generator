# Team Profile Generator

This application builds a team consisting of a Manager, Engineer & Intern as preset profiles.  The app is build using Node.js and uses a combination of dependencies/modules.  The user is prompted for input for each profile type, (manager, engineer or intern) which is generated using the inquirer package, using npm i inquirer.  After the user inputs all of the necessary information to build their team, an html page is generated, which displays cards styled using bootstrap and fontawesome & CSS, for each profile created.  Finally, testing is done for this application using jest and by running npm test.
